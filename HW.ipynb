They both\\n\\nof course choose to pay by the use of the (pause and gesture to audience\\n\\nfor response)\\n\\nAudience: Cheque\\n\\nJerry: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it\\'s a woman in front of you that\\'s\\n\\nwriting the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that\\n\\nwomen are very *fast* with cheques, y\\'know, \\'cuz they write out so many\\n\\ncheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don\\'t know\\n\\nwhere that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for\\n\\nthe cheque book-- the cheque book comes out of a holster: [\"draws\" imaginary\\n\\nbook from an imaginary holster] ``Who do I make it out to?... There\\'s my\\n\\nID...\\'\\'. There\\'s something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine.\\n\\nI don\\'t know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque is like a note\\n\\nfrom your mother that says ``I don\\'t have any money, but if you\\'ll\\n\\ncontact these people, I\\'m sure they\\'ll stick up for me... If you\\n\\njust trust me this one time I don\\'t have any money but I have\\n\\nthese... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?\\'\\'\\n\\n[End monologue]\\n\\n% Open at a video store where Jerry and some woman named \"Elaine\" are\\n\\n% apparently looking to rent a movie for the night.\\n\\nJerry: What\\'s that one?\\n\\nElaine: \"Coccoon II: The Return\". I guess they didn\\'t like it up there...\\n\\nJerry: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y\\'know Maureen Stapleton, if\\n\\nshe gets a craving, she\\'s probably screamin\\' at those aliens, \"I\\n\\ngotta have a Lo mein!\"\\n\\nElaine: Okay, what\\'re we doing here? I have seen *everything*.\\n\\nJerry: Oh yeah? I don\\'t believe you\\'ve seen... this.\\n\\n% Jerry shows Elaine some movie from the Adult section that\\'s probably\\n\\n% called \"The Sperminator\", or something...\\n\\nElaine: Oh, lovely...\\n\\nJerry: Yeah...\\n\\nElaine: What do you think their parents think?\\n\\nJerry: \"So, uh, what\\'s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s a public fornicator. Yes, he\\'s a fine boy...\"\\n\\nElaine: Y\\'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela\\'s\\n\\nbirthday.\\n\\nJerry: Pamela? Do I know her?\\n\\nElaine: Yeah, you met her when we were going out.\\n\\nJerry: Oh yeah, right...\\n\\nElaine: You have *no* idea who I\\'m talking about, do you?\\n\\nJerry: [quickly] No.\\n\\nElaine: Blonde hair remember? Glasses? [pause] Have you *totally* blocked\\n\\nout the entire time we were a couple?\\n\\n% Bing!\\n\\nJerry: Riverside Drive.\\n\\nElaine: Right! In fact... No, never mind...\\n\\nJerry: Well, what is it?\\n\\nElaine: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some\\n\\nbar for her birthday, but... you don\\'t want to go to... that... no.\\n\\nJerry: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.\\n\\nElaine: What little deal?\\n\\nJerry: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I\\n\\nhave on Saturday.\\n\\nElaine: A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?\\n\\nJerry: Y\\'know, my parents are coming in for this...\\n\\nElaine: They\\'re coming in?\\n\\nJerry: Yeah, tomorrow.\\n\\nElaine: Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?\\n\\nJerry: No, no... Still doin\\' the big *sweep* across.\\n\\nElaine: Why does he do that?\\n\\nJerry: Doesn\\'t think anyone can tell?\\n\\nJerry: So c\\'mon, do we have a deal?\\n\\nElaine: A *wedding*?\\n\\nJerry: There\\'s a lot of people to mock...\\n\\nElaine: Alright, what the Hell.\\n\\nJerry: Great!\\n\\nWoman: When you\\'re dead, you\\'re dead.

What do we have here...\\n\\nVanessa: Why don\\'t you relax and take your jacket off?\\n\\nJerry: Oh, I can\\'t-- I have a tendency to get chilly.\\n\\nVanessa: How masculine...\\n\\nJerry: Plus I\\'m wearing short sleeves, I don\\'t want to expose my tattoos.\\n\\n[To himself] She\\'s unbelievable!\\n\\n% The guy beside Venus, er, I mean Vanessa interrupts to tell her about this\\n\\n% unseen guy next to him.\\n\\nRoger: [To Vanessa] Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker...\\n\\nVanessa: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?\\n\\n% With their conversation interrupted, Jerry ponders to himself...\\n\\nJerry: [To himself] What\\'s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she\\'s\\n\\ntoo good to be alone... What\\'s the difference, I can\\'t maneuver\\n\\nanyway with Elaine next to me...\\n\\nVanessa: [To Jerry] How do you know Pamela?\\n\\nJerry: Friend of a friend. And you?\\n\\nVanessa: We went to law school together.\\n\\nElaine: Oh, Jerry!\\n\\nJerry: [To himself] Oh no, not *now*...\\n\\nElaine: I had this dream last night and you were in it.\\n\\nJerry: Oh really... [To himself] Oh God, I gotta get out of this...\\n\\nElaine: You were you, but, you weren\\'t you...\\n\\nJerry: No kidding... [To himself] Why is this happening? Please, make\\n\\nher stop!\\n\\nElaine: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were\\n\\nstanding there, you were looking out the window--\\n\\nJerry: [To himself] This is *brutal*...\\n\\nElaine: You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...\\n\\nJerry: How do you like that... [To himself] Can I turn now? Is this\\n\\nover? No, I can\\'t, I can\\'t... I\\'m stuck...\\n\\nElaine: Jerry? Are you listening to me?\\n\\nJerry: Yes, I *heard* you.\\n\\nPamela: Elaine, what\\'s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that\\n\\ntime?\\n\\nJerry: [To himself] Thank *you*, Pamela!\\n\\nJerry: [To Vanessa] So, you\\'re a lawyer...\\n\\nVanessa: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.\\n\\nJerry: [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.\\n\\nSagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft...\\n\\n[To Vanessa] Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit!\\n\\nVanessa: Oh, that was you!\\n\\nJerry: Imagine, spelling \"Mom\" with two O\\'s...\\n\\nVanessa: Very funny! What do you do?\\n\\nJerry: Comedian.\\n\\nVanessa: Really... That explains it...\\n\\nJerry: [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.\\n\\nSagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.\\n\\nRoger: Are you ready?\\n\\nVanessa: We gotta run. Happy birthday!\\n\\n% The two of them get up an leave. Jerry panics n his own mind...\\n\\nJerry: [To himself] I can\\'t believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don\\'t even\\n\\nknow her name!\\n\\n% Oh, poor Jerry. If only he would read my episode capsules, he would\\'ve\\n\\n% known her name 70 lines ago...\\n\\nJerry: [To himself, *very* quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and\\n\\nTaft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...\\n\\n% A grim stare from Elaine knocks his concentration. After the party, in\\n\\n% the cab home...\\n\\nJerry: That wasn\\'t so bad, really...\\n\\nElaine: Y\\'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.\\n\\nJerry: Why? What did I do?\\n\\n% You mean besides not bringing anything?\\n\\nElaine: Well, I just don\\'t appreciate these little \"courtesy responses\",\\n\\nlike I\\'m selling you aluminum siding.\\n\\nJerry: I was listening!\\n\\nElaine: No! You couldn\\'t wait to get back to your little... \"conversation\".\\n\\n% Okay Jerry. Bottom of the ninth. Two on, down by one. Two strikes on\\n\\n% you. Let\\'s see how you do in the clutch...\\n\\nJerry: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.\\n\\nElaine: Uh-huh...\\n\\n% So far, so good.\\n\\nJerry: Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.\\n\\n% Oops. Whiff.\\n\\nElaine: No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! *I*\\n\\ndidn\\'t have wooden teeth, *you* did!\\n\\nJerry: Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?\\n\\nElaine: So nothing... Nothing...\\n\\n% Cut to Jerry in a nightclub somewhere, doing another monologue...\\n\\nJerry: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic\\n\\nrelationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after\\n\\nhimself. He said ``Yeah, I got this new thing-- \"platonic\". My\\n\\nidea, my name, callin\\' it after myself... What I do is, I go *out*\\n\\nwith the girls, I *talk* with them-- don\\'t *do* anything... and go\\n\\nright home. What\\'dya think? I think it\\'s going to be *big*!\\'\\'\\n\\nI bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get\\n\\nrelationships named after them, but it didn\\'t work. Y\\'know, I bet\\n\\nyou there were guys who tried to do it, just went: ``Hi, my name\\'s\\n\\nRico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it\\'s a\\n\\n*\"Riconic\"* relationship...\\'\\'\\n\\n% Jerry gets home after the party. His place is characteristically not\\n\\n% vacant, but it\\'s not Kramer inside-- it\\'s his folks.\\n\\nJerry: Hey!\\n\\nMorty: Ah, there he is!\\n\\nJerry: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your\\n\\nbed!\\n\\nHelen: Y\\'know, Jerry, we don\\'t have to do this...\\n\\nJerry: What are you talkin\\' about? It\\'s fine, I love having you here...\\n\\nHelen: Tomorrow we\\'ll go to a hotel.\\n\\nJerry: Ma, will you stop?\\n\\nHelen: No, why should we take over your apartment?\\n\\nJerry: I don\\'t care-- I\\'m sleeping next door.\\n\\nHelen: Your friend Kramer doesn\\'t mind?\\n\\nJerry: No, he\\'s making a bouillabaisse.\\n\\nJerry: So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big\\n\\nlaw offices?\\n\\nMorty: Depends on the firm.\\n\\nJerry: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they\\n\\nwould know who it was?\\n\\nMorty: What\\'s the matter? You need a lawyer?\\n\\nJerry: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I\\n\\ndon\\'t know her name.\\n\\nMorty: So why don\\'t you ask someone who was at the party?\\n\\nJerry: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can\\'t ask her.\\n\\nHelen: Why not?\\n\\nJerry: Because it\\'s complicated-- there\\'s some tension there.\\n\\nHelen: He used to go with her...\\n\\nHelen: Which one is she?\\n\\nMorty: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered\\n\\ncherries you didn\\'t like.\\n\\nMorty: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.\\n\\nJerry: Oh yeah, she\\'s great.\\n\\nHelen: So, how come nothing materialized there?\\n\\nJerry: Well, it\\'s a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...\\n\\nHelen: I know what it was...\\n\\nJerry: You don\\'t know what it was...\\n\\nHelen: So, what was it?\\n\\nJerry: Well, we fight a lot for some reason...\\n\\n% Both his parents respond in that \"You know so little son, that\\'s to be\\n\\n% expected\", sarcastic, know-it-all tone...\\n\\nH + M: Oh, well...\\n\\nJerry: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...\\n\\n% Oops. Cat got your collective tongue, folks? They occupy themselves\\n\\n% for a few seconds, not knowing how to respond to *that*...\\n\\nHelen: Well, I think she\\'s a very attractive girl.\\n\\nJerry: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.\\n\\nHelen: I can see if there was a *weight* problem...\\n\\nJerry: No, it\\'s not that. It wasn\\'t all one-sided.\\n\\n% Why, Jerry? How could anyone not like you?\\n\\nHelen: You know, you can\\'t be so particular. Nobody\\'s perfect.\\n\\n% Except maybe Jerry. Right, Mrs. Seinfeld?\\n\\nJerry: I know, I know...\\n\\nMorty: Y\\'know Jerry, it\\'s a good thing I wasn\\'t so particular.\\n\\nHelen: Idiot... [To Jerry] So who\\'re you looking for, Sophia Loren?\\n\\nJerry: That\\'s got *nothin\\'* to do with it.\\n\\nMorty: How about Loni Anderson?\\n\\nHelen: Where do you get Loni Anderson?\\n\\nMorty: Why, what\\'s wrong with Loni Anderson?\\n\\nHelen: I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...\\n\\n% That makes a bunch of us, Mrs. Seinfeld...\\n\\nJerry: What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn\\'t \"the one\".\\n\\nHelen: And this other one\\'s \"the one\"?\\n\\nJerry: I dunno, maybe...\\n\\nMorty: So ask Elaine there for the number.\\n\\nJerry: I can\\'t-- she\\'ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her,\\n\\nespecially this one tonight.\\n\\nHelen: How could you still see her if your not interested?\\n\\nJerry: We\\'re *friends*.\\n\\nMorty: Doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re friends to me. If you were friends you\\'d\\n\\nask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?\\n\\nJerry: Oh yeah...\\n\\n% Yeah, but can he say it six times fast? Actually, he probably can...\\n\\nMorty: Well, go up to the office.\\n\\nHelen: Up to her office?\\n\\nMorty: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn\\'t she?\\n\\nJerry: I guess...\\n\\nMorty: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to\\n\\ncome down for lunch.\\n\\nJerry: You mean \"stakeout\" the lobby?\\n\\nHelen: Morty, that\\'s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!\\n\\nMorty: He doesn\\'t want to ask Elaine for the number.\\n\\nHelen: So you\\'ve got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! What\\n\\nhappens when he sees her?\\n\\nMorty: He pretends he *bumped* into her!\\n\\nJerry: Y\\'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...\\n\\n% At the building, G+J start to plot their strategy.\\n\\nGeorge: What does she look like?\\n\\nJerry: I dunno. Hard to say.\\n\\nGeorge: What actress does she remind you of?\\n\\nJerry: Loni Anderson.\\n\\nGeorge: Loni Anderson?!\\n\\nJerry: What, there\\'s something wrong with Loni Anderson?\\n\\nJerry: Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.\\n\\nGeorge: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think\\n\\nI wanna miss this?\\n\\nJerry: I\\'m a little nervous.\\n\\nGeorge: Yeah, me too...\\n\\nJerry: If I see her, what do I say that I\\'m doing here in the building?\\n\\nGeorge: You came to see me; I work in the building.\\n\\nJerry: What do you do?\\n\\nGeorge: I\\'m an *architect*.\\n\\nJerry: You\\'re an *architect*?\\n\\nGeorge: I\\'m not?\\n\\nJerry: I don\\'t see architecture comin from you...\\n\\nGeorge: I suppose *you* could be an architect...\\n\\nJerry: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin\\' else...\\n\\nGeorge: Alright, she\\'s not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which is remote.\\n\\nJerry: Well what\\'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!\\n\\nGeorge: We\\'re having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.\\n\\nJerry: What is *his* name?\\n\\nGeorge: Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.\\n\\nJerry: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.\\n\\nGeorge: No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr.....\\n\\nJerry: Art Corr...\\n\\nGeorge: ...velay...\\n\\nJerry: Corvelay?\\n\\nGeorge: Yeah, right.\\n\\nJerry: Well, what does *he* do?\\n\\nGeorge: He\\'s an importer.\\n\\nJerry: Just imports, no exports?\\n\\nGeorge: He\\'s an importer/exporter, okay?\\n\\nGeorge: Say, did Elaine ever call you back?\\n\\nJerry: No, I guess she\\'s still mad.\\n\\nGeorge: I don\\'t understand, you never talk to her about other women?\\n\\nJerry: Never.\\n\\n% Bing! The elevator opens up and...\\n\\nJerry: Wait a second... That\\'s her... on the right.\\n\\nGeorge: I forgot who I am! Who am I?!\\n\\nJerry: You\\'re you. We\\'re having lunch with Art Corvelay.\\n\\nGeorge: Vandelay!\\n\\nJerry: Corvelay!\\n\\nGeorge: Let me be the architect, I can do it!\\n\\n% Jerry ignores George and approaches Vanessa.\\n\\nJerry: Hey, hey... Pamela\\'s birthday party, didn\\'t I see you there...\\n\\nJerry.\\n\\nVanessa: Sure! Hi!\\n\\nJerry: This is George.

He\\'s an importer.\\n\\nVanessa: Importer?\\n\\nGeorge: ...And exporter.\\n\\nJerry: He\\'s an importer/exporter.\\n\\nGeorge: I\\'m, uh, I\\'m an architect.\\n\\nVanessa: Really. What do you design?\\n\\nGeorge: Uh, railroads, uh...\\n\\nVanessa: I thought engineers do that.\\n\\nGeorge: They can...\\n\\nJerry: Y\\'know I\\'m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.\\n\\nVanessa: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.\\n\\nJerry: Oh, that guy was your *cousin*!\\n\\nVanessa: Yeah, and that woman was your--\\n\\nJerry: Friend!\\n\\nGeorge: I\\'ll just, uh, get a paper...\\n\\nJerry: So, um, do you date immature men?\\n\\nVanessa: Almost exclusively...\\n\\n% I\\'m next!

Dad, she\\'s cheating!\\n\\nKramer: \"Quo\"? That\\'s not a word.\\n\\nHelen: [To Jerry] You\\'re such a stickler...\\n\\nJerry: Well put *something* down, you\\'re taking twenty minutes on this.\\n\\nSo is Uncle Mac, and Artie, they\\'re all coming over here before the\\n\\nwedding?\\n\\nHelen: They\\'ll be here at two o\\'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said\\n\\nshe\\'d be here at 2:30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went\\n\\nwell with Art... \"Vandelay\"?\\'\\'\\n\\nJerry: She said *what*?\\n\\nHelen: Just what I said, here.\\n\\n% She hands Jerry the note.

Why the Hell did I bring the wagon?\\n\\nJerry: Anyway, you know why I didn\\'t ask you, I mean I felt so\\n\\nuncomfortable, and you were *so* annoyed in the cab.\\n\\nElaine: Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before.

Anyway, I\\n\\nadmit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean,\\n\\nobviously we have a little problem here.\\n\\nElaine: Yeah, obviously.\\n\\nJerry: I mean, if we\\'re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about\\n\\nother people...\\n\\nElaine: Couldn\\'t agree more.\\n\\nJerry: Good.\\n\\nElaine: Good.\\n\\nJerry: Good.\\n\\nElaine: Great!\\n\\nJerry: Great? Where do you get \"great\"?\\n\\nElaine: It\\'s great to... talk about... other people...\\n\\nJerry: ...Guys.\\n\\nElaine: Yeah.\\n\\nJerry: Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?\\n\\nElaine: No. A general guy.\\n\\nJerry: Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...\\n\\nElaine: What? No, it\\'s not a big deal.\\n\\nJerry: No, that\\'s great! That\\'s terrific!\\n\\nElaine: No, we just met...\\n\\nJerry: Doesn\\'t matter. What\\'s the young man\\'s name? I would like to\\n\\nmeet him.\\n\\nElaine: I don\\'t think so...\\n\\nJerry: Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer\\n\\nof some sort?\\n\\nElaine: Wall street.\\n\\nJerry: Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut.\\n\\nElaine: And he happens to be pretty good lookin\\'\\n\\nJerry: [pause] Alright, sir.\\n\\nElaine: And... he\\'s *hilarious*.\\n\\nJerry: Now that\\'s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?\\n\\nElaine: I \"staked\" out his health club.\\n\\n% This is why I\\'ll never be a writer. To me, this would\\'ve been \"stook\\n\\n% out\". I\\'m such a dweeb...\\n\\nJerry: When you\\'re on a stakeout, do you find it\\'s better to stand up\\n\\nagainst the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?...\\n\\n% Closing monologue\\n\\nJerry: Y\\'know I think that even if you\\'ve had a relationship with someone,\\n\\nor let\\'s say, *especially* if you\\'ve had a relationship with someone\\n\\nand you try to become friends afterwards, it\\'s very difficult.\\n\\nIsn\\'t this? It\\'s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you\\n\\nknow all of each others tricks. It\\'s like two magicians, trying to\\n\\nentertain each other.\\n\\nThe one goes, \"Look, a rabbit.\"\\n\\nThe other goes, \"So? ... I believe this is your card.\"\\n\\n\"Look, why don\\'t we just saw each other in half and call it a night?\\n\\nOkay?\"\\n\\n[End]'"

       "'Mr. Tuttle: Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We\\n\\nhave a small but prestigious group of clients.\\n\\nGeorge: Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.\\n\\nMr. Tuttle: That\\'s funny George. You\\'re very quick. I feel like I, like I don\\'t have to explain every little\\n\\nthing to you. You understand everything immediately.\\n\\nGeorge: I enjoy understanding.\\n\\nMr. Tuttle: I want you to have this job. Of course...\\n\\nSecretary: Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.\\n\\nMr. Tuttle: Thanks. I\\'ve got to take this call. Listen, I\\'m really glad that you came in.\\n\\n(commercial)\\n\\nAt Monk\\'s\\n\\nGeorge: I want you to have this job. Of course...\\n\\nJerry: Yeah?\\n\\nGeorge: That\\'s it.\\n\\nJerry: What do you mean that\\'s it?\\n\\nGeorge: He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.\\n\\nJerry: \"Of course\" was the last thing he said?\\n\\nGeorge: Maybe he was going to say \"Of course I have to check with my associates.\"\\n\\nElaine: \"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be\\n\\nserving time.\"\\n\\nJerry: \"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.\"\\n\\nGeorge: All right.\\n\\nElaine: Why don\\'t you go ahead and call him?\\n\\nGeorge: Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That\\'s what\\n\\nimpressed him.\\n\\nJerry: So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.\\n\\nGeorge: And if I don\\'t call...\\n\\nJerry: You might have the job, but you\\'ll never know it. What kind of company is it?\\n\\nGeorge: Rest stop supply.\\n\\nKramer comes in and sits down.\\n\\nKramer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.\\n\\nJerry: Shower?\\n\\nKramer: Haircut.\\n\\nJerry: Who\\'d you use? Gino?\\n\\nKramer: Oh course. I wouldn\\'t let that other butcher cut my hair.\\n\\nElaine: What butcher?\\n\\nKramer: The uncle Enzo. That\\'s the guy Jerry uses.\\n\\nJerry: Well I\\'ve been going with him for 12 years. I can\\'t switch. I\\'d hurt his feelings.\\n\\nElaine: You never get good haircuts.\\n\\nKramer: You can get a good one today. It\\'s Enzo\\'s day off. Gino\\'s there all by himself.\\n\\nJerry: Really?\\n\\nElaine: Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor\\n\\nauction.\\n\\nKramer: What bachelor auction?\\n\\nElaine: Oh it\\'s a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.\\n\\nKramer: And you didn\\'t ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.\\n\\nJerry: I believe they\\'ve had a cure for polio for quite some time.\\n\\nKramer: Polio?\\n\\nElaine: Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.\\n\\nJerry: Okay.\\n\\nKramer: What are you all dressed up for?\\n\\nGeorge: I had a job interview.\\n\\nKramer: Yeah. How\\'d it go?\\n\\nGeorge: Good. Of course...\\n\\nAt the barber shop\\n\\nEnzo: Oh Jerry.\\n\\nJerry: Oh hi Enzo.\\n\\nEnzo: Oh, you\\'ve come for the haircut.\\n\\nJerry: No, actually I was just...\\n\\nEnzo: It\\'s my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you\\'re my favorite customer. You\\'ve been\\n\\nwith me for so long. You\\'re so loyal.\\n\\nJerry: Well I, if it\\'s your day off I really... (tries to leave)\\n\\nEnzo: (He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can\\'t.) Eh, what\\'s the difference.\\n\\nIt takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I\\'m going to do something special for you.\\n\\nJerry: Well I don\\'t want to take too much off.\\n\\nEnzo: Hey who\\'s your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.\\n\\nMan: Gino, you\\'ve outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nAt Jerry\\'s apartment.\\n\\nJerry is sitting down on the couch with a really bad haircut. He is holding a mirror. Jerry and George are\\n\\nlooking in disbelief at the haircut.\\n\\nGeorge: He massacred you. You look like you\\'re five years old.\\n\\nJerry: What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.\\n\\nGeorge: You\\'ve got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.\\n\\nJerry: I can\\'t. He loves me. He says I\\'m his most loyal customer. Plus he\\'s right there on the corner. I\\'d\\n\\nhave to pass him every day when I go by.\\n\\nGeorge: You gotta do it.\\n\\nJerry: I can\\'t, I can\\'t. I\\'d break his heart.\\n\\nKramer enters. He flinches when he sees the haircut.\\n\\nKramer: No way my Gino did that. It\\'s an Enzo.\\n\\nJerry: He did the job. You told me he wasn\\'t going to be there.\\n\\nKramer: So what?\\n\\nJerry: I didn\\'t want to hurt his feelings.\\n\\nKramer: His feelings? You can\\'t continue seeing him. You\\'re destroying yourself. I\\'m not going to let\\n\\nyou. If you don\\'t call him I will.\\n\\nJerry: No Kramer. I don\\'t want you to do that. You can\\'t do that.\\n\\nKramer: I\\'m going to call Gino, you\\'re going to see him, and we\\'re going to get that haircut fixed up.\\n\\nJerry: I don\\'t want you to call him.\\n\\nKramer: All right, geez. You\\'re crazy.\\n\\nKramer leaves.\\n\\nGeorge: So I still haven\\'t heard about that job.\\n\\nJerry: Yeah that\\'s a tough one. What are you going to do about that?\\n\\nGeorge: I have an idea.\\n\\nJerry: Yeah?\\n\\nGeorge: I show up.\\n\\nJerry: What do you mean you show up?\\n\\nGeorge: I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy\\'s on vacation. If I have the job, it\\'s fine. If I don\\'t\\n\\nhave the job, by the time he comes back, I\\'m ensconced.\\n\\nJerry: Hmm. Not bad.\\n\\nGeorge: What\\'s the worst thing that could happen?\\n\\nJerry: Well, you\\'d be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out\\n\\nin shame with your tail between your legs.\\n\\nGeorge: Yeah, so?\\n\\nAt the office.\\n\\nGeorge: (to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see\\n\\nyou. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.\\n\\nSecretary: How can I help you?\\n\\nGeorge: The name\\'s George Constanza. I\\'m starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell\\n\\nme where my office is.\\n\\nSecretary: I wasn\\'t aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He\\'s starting here today.\\n\\nMike: Welcome aboard.\\n\\nGeorge: Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.\\n\\nMike: I wasn\\'t aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.\\n\\nGeorge: Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.\\n\\nSecretary: He wants to know where his office is.\\n\\nMike: Oh, ah, let\\'s see, we\\'ve got two. There\\'s a big one down the hall there and a small one over here.\\n\\nYou know I should ask Jack.\\n\\nGeorge: Oh leave Jack alone. Jack\\'s got enough problems. I\\'ll just take the small office.\\n\\nMike: Really?\\n\\nGeorge: Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love\\n\\nto be nestled.\\n\\nMike: All right, it\\'s 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I\\'ll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.\\n\\nGeorge: Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can\\'t wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that\\n\\nPensky. Well we\\'ll straighten him out.\\n\\nGeorge walks into his office. He sets down his briefcase and coat and sits down. He quickly flips through\\n\\nthe folder, then drops the folder on his desk with a big thud.\\n\\nCamera shot at the clock on his wall. The clock says 9:00.\\n\\nA moment later, the clock flips to 5:00.\\n\\nGeorge puts the folder in his briefcase. He picks up the briefcase and his coat and he walks out.\\n\\nAt Monk\\'s. Jerry is wearing a baseball cap.\\n\\nJerry: So what did you do there all day?\\n\\nGeorge: They gave me the Pensky file.\\n\\nJerry: So it\\'s a nice place to work?\\n\\nGeorge: You know I\\'m enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.\\n\\n*flashback* (a white fuzzy border is around the TV screen)\\n\\nGeorge: (continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace\\'s birthday. She\\'s such a sweet\\n\\nwoman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.\\n\\n*end flashback*\\n\\nJerry: What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?\\n\\nGeorge: He\\'ll be back on Monday.\\n\\nElaine enters and sits down.\\n\\nJerry: Hi.\\n\\nElaine: Hi. How come you\\'re wearing a hat?\\n\\nJerry: I got a haircut.\\n\\nElaine: Oh yeah? Can I see it?\\n\\nJerry: Oh there\\'s nothing to see.\\n\\nElaine: Come on. Let me see it.\\n\\nJerry: Forget it.\\n\\nElaine: Come on.\\n\\nJerry: All right.\\n\\nJerry takes off his baseball cap. Elaine bursts out laughing. George starts laughing. Jerry rolls his eyes in\\n\\nthe air. Elaine and George are still laughing. George pounds his fist on the table.\\n\\nElaine: (still laughing, tears in her eyes) I\\'m sorry. I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nJerry: Well I\\'ll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.\\n\\nElaine: What? No Jerry, you have to go.\\n\\nGeorge: You know Elaine, I\\'d do it but I\\'m working that day.\\n\\nElaine: (dryly) Yeah, too bad.\\n\\nAt the barber shop. Gino is giving Kramer a shave.\\n\\nKramer: It the worst haircut Jerry\\'s ever had. You gotta fix it.\\n\\nGino: Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He\\'s a little crazy. I don\\'t know what\\n\\nhe\\'d do if he found out I touch Jerry\\'s hair. (Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That\\'s the\\n\\nbest movie I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nEnzo: Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like scissors, huh? Show me\\n\\none person who\\'s got hand like scissors.\\n\\nGino: Hey, it\\'s a beautiful dream. I\\'d love to be this man.\\n\\nEnzo: Did you ever think about what you\\'re going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do\\n\\non the toilet?\\n\\nKramer: I\\'d like to have shoehorn hands.\\n\\nAt Monk\\'s.\\n\\nKramer: Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he\\'s going to fix the haircut.\\n\\nElaine: Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.\\n\\nJerry: Yeah, but how am I...\\n\\nKramer: No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o\\'clock.\\n\\nElaine: Can he fix it?\\n\\nKramer: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAt Gino\\'s apartment.\\n\\nGino: Boy, you\\'ve got a beautiful head of hair.\\n\\nJerry: Thank you.\\n\\nGino: I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.\\n\\nJerry: Well actually Enzo hasn\\'t said that to me in a while.\\n\\nGino: I don\\'t think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.\\n\\nJerry: That\\'s nice of you to say.\\n\\nThe buzzer buzzes.\\n\\nGino: Just a second. Yes.\\n\\nEnzo: (over the speaker) It\\'s your uncle Enzo.\\n\\nGino: It\\'s Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I\\'ll clean up.\\n\\n\"The Barber of Seville\" music is playing.\\n\\nGino picks up the chair and puts it into the closet. He picks up a broom and sweeps some hair into the next\\n\\nroom.\\n\\n*knock, knock, knock*\\n\\nGino opens the door.\\n\\nGino: Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?\\n\\nEnzo: I\\'ve come to apologize.\\n\\nGino: Apologize?\\n\\nEnzo: Yes. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.\\n\\nGino: He make me cry too. You want something to drink?\\n\\nEnzo: Hey, what\\'s all of this?\\n\\nGino: Nothing. It\\'s just hair.\\n\\nEnzo: You do haircut in the apartment?\\n\\nGino: No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He\\'s going bald.\\n\\nEnzo: It looks very familiar.\\n\\n(commercial)\\n\\nAt Jerry\\'s apartment.\\n\\nJerry: In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.\\n\\nKramer: Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it.\\n\\nJerry: Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.\\n\\nKramer: Yeah, so?\\n\\nJerry: I think he knew.\\n\\nKramer: No. He doesn\\'t know.\\n\\nJerry: Who do you know? He knows my hair.\\n\\nKramer: Listen you\\'re just imagining things. He doesn\\'t know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself\\n\\ntogether.\\n\\nJerry: Okay, okay.\\n\\nElaine enters.\\n\\nElaine: What happened? It looks the same.\\n\\nJerry: He didn\\'t get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.\\n\\nElaine: Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.\\n\\nJerry: Take the K-man.\\n\\nElaine: You can still go.\\n\\nKramer: What are you kidding? Look at him. He\\'s grotesque.\\n\\nElaine: You think?\\n\\nKramer: Do I think? He\\'s repugnant.\\n\\nElaine fiddles with the hair, trying to make it not look so bad. It doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nElaine: What would you wear?\\n\\nKramer: Whatever it takes.\\n\\nAt the barber shop.\\n\\nEnzo: See, now Newman is a good customer.\\n\\nNewman: Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent\\n\\nfor it.\\n\\nEnzo: Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal.\\n\\nNewman: Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I\\'m special.\\n\\nEnzo: You know I don\\'t mind if somebody\\'s funny, but I no like the funny business.\\n\\nGino: I\\'m going to go out for a little bit. I\\'ll be right back.\\n\\nEnzo: Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?\\n\\nNewman: It\\'s okay. A little crooked.\\n\\nEnzo: How\\'d you like to have free haircut for six months.\\n\\nNewman: What\\'s the catch?\\n\\nEnzo: You\\'re going to get me a sample of Jerry\\'s hair.\\n\\nNewman: Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year\\'s* free haircuts. And a comb.\\n\\nAt George\\'s office.\\n\\nGeorge is \"playing the drums\" on his desk. He is tapping his desk with pencils.\\n\\n*buzz*\\n\\nSecretary: (over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.\\n\\nGeorge: Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?\\n\\nPensky enters.\\n\\nPensky: Costanza? Arthur Pensky.\\n\\nGeorge: Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this\\n\\nflexible accordion-style folder.\\n\\nPensky: Where\\'s Tuttle?\\n\\nGeorge: He\\'s on vacation.\\n\\nPensky: He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. (looks through the file) Looks\\n\\nlike you put a lot of work into this.\\n\\nGeorge: Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.\\n\\nPensky: Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?\\n\\nGeorge: Really?\\n\\nPensky: You are aware...\\n\\n*buzz*\\n\\nSecretary: (over the speaker) Mr. Castanza?\\n\\nGeorge: Not now Florice.\\n\\nSecretary: (speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they\\'re towing his car.\\n\\nPensky: Damn this city.\\n\\nPensky leaves.\\n\\nGeorge: I am aware. I am aware.\\n\\nAt Jerry\\'s apartment.\\n\\nGino: He knows. He knows about us.\\n\\nJerry: How do you know?\\n\\nGino: Because I know. He\\'s crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He *staring* at the hair.\\n\\n*knock knock knock*\\n\\nJerry: Who is it?\\n\\nNewman: It\\'s Newman.\\n\\nGino: He was in the shop with Enzo. He can\\'t see me here.\\n\\nJerry: All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.\\n\\nJerry opens the door.\\n\\nJerry: What do you want?\\n\\nNewman: Can I use your bathroom?\\n\\nJerry: What\\'s wrong with yours?\\n\\nNewman: My toilet\\'s clogged.\\n\\nJerry: You can\\'t unclog it?\\n\\nNewman: No.\\n\\nJerry: Did you ask Kramer?\\n\\nNewman: He\\'s out.\\n\\nJerry: Number one?\\n\\nNewman: Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.\\n\\nJerry: All right. Flush twice.\\n\\nHe goes in the bathroom.\\n\\nNewman: (thinking to himself) (checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don\\'t believe this.\\n\\nThere\\'s no hair in this thing. I\\'ve never seen a person that didn\\'t have at least *one* hair in a brush.\\n\\n(searches the bathtub drain) Unbelievable, nothing. (sees some scissors) Ahh.\\n\\nJerry: You all right?\\n\\nNewman: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nJerry: All right, I\\'ll see you later.\\n\\nNewman: What are you doing?\\n\\nJerry: I\\'m watching Edward Scissorhands.\\n\\nNewman: Oh, can I watch a little? It\\'s my favorite movie.\\n\\nJerry: Yeah all right.\\n\\nNewman follows behind Jerry closely as Jerry goes to the kitchen. Newman puts the scissors close up to\\n\\nJerry\\'s hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors.\\n\\nJerry: You want something to drink?\\n\\nNewman: No.\\n\\nNewman tries again as Jerry goes to his couch. Newman follows behind Jerry closely. Newman puts the\\n\\nscissors close up to Jerry\\'s hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors. Jerry looks at Newman\\n\\nconfused.\\n\\nJerry: If you want to watch, sit down. You\\'re making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of\\n\\na barber.\\n\\nNewman reaches behind Jerry and get a snip of hair.\\n\\nNewman: Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)\\n\\nNewman leaves laughing. Jerry looks confused.\\n\\nAt the barber shop.\\n\\nEnzo: Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.\\n\\nNewman: It was a cinch. Where are you going?\\n\\nEnzo: Io volgio vandetta.\\n\\nAt the auction house.\\n\\nElaine: Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.\\n\\nWoman: A thousand.\\n\\nElaine: A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky\\n\\nlady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.\\n\\nKramer peeks out the curtain and comes out and walks around on stage.\\n\\nElaine: Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He\\'s uh, he\\'s a high school graduate.\\n\\nKramer: Equivalent.\\n\\nElaine: Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. He\\'s uh, self-employed. He\\'s...\\n\\nI don\\'t know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.\\n\\nKramer steps from the stage onto a table. The table tips over and Kramer falls off.\\n\\nElaine: Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don\\'t we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks?\\n\\nAt Jerry\\'s apartment.\\n\\nJerry: I don\\'t get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or\\n\\nsomebody? What\\'s with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.\\n\\n*knock, knock, knock*\\n\\nJerry: Who is it?\\n\\nEnzo: (yelling) Enzo Manginero.\\n\\n\"Barber of Seville\" music playing.\\n\\nJerry: Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.\\n\\nEnzo: It was you that was in Gino\\'s apartment the other night.\\n\\nJerry: No I wasn\\'t there.\\n\\nEnzo: Don\\'t lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.\\n\\nJerry: Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.\\n\\nGino: Don\\'t Jerry.\\n\\nEnzo: So, it\\'s true.\\n\\nGino: Yes it\\'s true.\\n\\nEnzo: I\\'m going to kill the both of you.\\n\\nEnzo notices \"Edward Scissorhands\" playing on the TV and becomes calm.\\n\\nAt the office.\\n\\nGeorge is at his desk sleeping with a newspaper draped over him. Tuttle walks in. He bangs on the door.\\n\\nGeorge wakes up.\\n\\nGeorge: Mr. Tuttle, you\\'re back.\\n\\nTuttle: George, I\\'m surprised to see you here.\\n\\nGeorge: You are?\\n\\nTuttle: I though you would have taken the large office.\\n\\nGeorge: Oh. Really.\\n\\nTuttle: I guess I didn\\'t make that clear when I hired you. So where\\'s that Pensky file? Let\\'s see what\\n\\nyou\\'ve been up to all week. (pages through the file) What have you been doing all week?\\n\\nGeorge: Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.\\n\\nTuttle: You haven\\'t done anything with this.\\n\\nGeorge: Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.\\n\\nTuttle: I\\'m beginning to wonder if you understand anything.\\n\\nGeorge: You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.\\n\\nTuttle: (scoffs) You\\'re not Pensky material.\\n\\nGeorge: Well, we\\'ll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.\\n\\nAt Jerry\\'s apartment.\\n\\nGino and Enzo are watching \"Edward Scissorhands\" on TV. They are both sobbing.\\n\\nAt the barber shop.\\n\\n\"Barber of Seville\" music is playing.\\n\\nJerry looks in the barber shop window and sees Newman giving a guy a haircut. He enters. Newman looks\\n\\nat him scared. Jerry picks up an electric razor and walks toward Newman. Newman is very frightened.\\n\\n(commercial)\\n\\nPensky: Gee George, I\\'m sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you\\n\\nare aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we\\'re prohibited from doing\\n\\nbusiness until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.\\n\\nGeorge: Obviously.\\n\\n*buzz*\\n\\nPensky: Yes.\\n\\nSecretary: (over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza\\'s car is being towed.\\n\\nGeorge waves his hand and the final note of \"Barber of Seville\" plays.'"
